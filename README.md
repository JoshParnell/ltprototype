# Limit Theory Prototype

This is the original Limit Theory Prototype, a pre-alpha demo released to Kickstarter backers in 2013.

Source code for this demo has long since been lost, however the installer is still alive and working!

You can download the installer here: https://github.com/JoshParnell/ltprototype/releases/download/v1.0/LTPInstaller.exe .
